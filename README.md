# cost_of_data_comparison
The main goal of this project is to take a data set and visualization and try to improve upon it / fix some mistakes.
Within comparison_visualized the first image seen is the data visualization I attempted to improve.
The problems that I set out to try and address were as such:
1. Clutter
2. Readability
3. Objective

Clutter: The visualization just had too much going on in my opinion, it was not easy to grasp the data within 10 seconds. So I wanted to make my data visualizations not be as cluttered.
Readablilty: It was hard to get an idea of what the data actually looked like because of the way it is formatted, it is hard to contextualize just how much or how little of a difference there is using the original visualization because all of the data is on top of one another.
Objective: While the objective of the original data set is easy to understand it is unclear how much the data supported the objective.
