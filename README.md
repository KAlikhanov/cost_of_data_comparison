# cost_of_data_comparison
## Goal of this project
The main goal of this project is to take a data set and visualization and try to improve upon it / fix some mistakes.
Within comparison_visualized the first image seen is the data visualization I attempted to improve.
The problems that I set out to try and address were as such:

1. Clutter : The visualization just had too much going on in my opinion, it was not easy to grasp the data within 10 seconds. So I wanted to make my data visualizations not be as cluttered.
2. Readablilty: It was hard to get an idea of what the data actually looked like because of the way it is formatted, it is hard to contextualize just how much or how little of a difference there is using the original visualization because all of the data is on top of one another.
3. Objective: While the objective of the original data set is easy to understand it is unclear how much the data supported the objective.

## Data visualizations
Below is an image of my visualization, and below that will be an image of the original.

## Analysis and reasoning
It is easy to see how the original visualization is a lot more fancy than mine.
But my goal was to make the data less cluttered, more readable, and more driven.

First, I cut down the data set. The data that I chose to keep was the 20 cheapest and 20 most expensive countries.
By doing this I decluttered the data to just include what I wanted to use for my visualization. This also helps with the objective as it makes it easier to see
how the data supports my claims when comparing the extremes.

Second, I chose to go with a bar graph, it is easily readable and will show off the comparisons between the data set in a very obvious way. Because this format for a data visualization is simple that also means it is very readable while effectively getting a message across to the audience.

I decided to go with three visualizations because even though I cut down on the data it is still a lot to digest with just one graph. Having one section, a second section, and then them combined makes it easier to understand for the audience.

In the original visualization they included some extra information, I decided to not put that information on my data but rather include it in the code below it in comparison_visualized. This is so that information wise my visualization is not lacking when compared to the original. Though I omitted some of the extraneous information that could not be derived from the data/ was not relevant.
